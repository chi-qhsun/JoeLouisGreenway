        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The Joe Louis Greenway is a 27.5-mile urban trail designed to connect
          and rejuvenate diverse communities across Detroit. Named after the
          legendary boxer and civil rights advocate Joe Louis, this greenway
          extends through various neighborhoods, promoting connectivity,
          community well-being, and economic revitalization.

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Aimed at enhancing urban life, the greenway provides safe, accessible
          paths for walking, biking, and more, linking residents to parks,
          waterfronts, and cultural sites. It serves as a dynamic space for
          health, wellness, and community engagement.

          The development of the greenway is a collaborative effort, deeply
          involving local residents to ensure it reflects their needs and
          values. It also aims to stimulate local economies and encourage social
          cohesion by connecting historically segregated neighborhoods.
