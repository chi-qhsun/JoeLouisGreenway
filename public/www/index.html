        <h2>Joe Louis Greenway Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Joe Louis Greenway is a 27.5-mile urban trail connecting multiple
          Detroit neighborhoods, as well as Highland Park, Hamtramck, and
          Dearborn. Named for legendary boxer and civil rights advocate Joe
          Louis, the trail is designed to promote safe, accessible routes for
          walking and biking, while revitalizing communities and fostering local
          economic growth.

        <h2>Warren Gateway</h2>
        <p>
          The $6 million Warren Gateway segment marks the first constructed
          trailhead on the Detroit–Dearborn border. It features a four-acre park
          west of Central Avenue, with a playscape, a pavilion for community
          events, fitness equipment, green infrastructure, and accessible
          parking. This new space was funded by a $3 million grant from the
          Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Foundation and $3 million in city bond funds.
